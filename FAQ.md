# FAQs: <!-- omit in toc -->

## Q1: "How do I build shwild?"

See instructions in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## Q2: "Does shwild have its own unit-tests?"

Yes, but to minimise dependencies it uses a simplistic, `assert()`-based, unit-test library - called [**Brain-Dead Unit-Testing**](https://synesissoftware.com/bdut) - supplied in the file **include/shwild/bdut/bdut.h**.
